Step-by-step guide: How to Git Pull from an upstream branch Introduction: In the world of software development, collaboration and version control are important.
 A popular version control system is Git, known for its distributed and decentralized nature.
 When working with Git, creating a repository allows you to create a copy of an existing project, which you can then modify and contribute to without affecting the original codebase.
 However, it is important to update your forked repository  with  changes made to the original repository.
 This is where the “git pull” command comes into play.
 In this blog post, we will explore how to git pull from an upstream branch in a few simple steps.
 Step 1: Clone your forked repository: Before you can pull changes from the upstream repository, you need to clone the forked repository to your local machine.
 Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder where you want to clone the repository.
 Then use the following command: ''' git clone ''' Replace '' with the URL of your forked repository.
 Git will create a local copy of the repository on your machine.
 Step 2: Add the upstream remote: To pull changes from the original repository or upstream, you need to add it as a remote.
 In your terminal, navigate to the cloned repository and execute the following command: ''' git remote add upstream ''' Replace '' with the URL of the original repository.
 This command adds a remote called "upstream" that points to the original repository.
 Step 3: Fetch the upstream changes: Before pulling the changes, it's important to fetch the latest changes from the upstream repository.
 Execute the following command: ''' git fetch upstream ''' This command fetches all the branches and latest changes from the upstream repository to your local repository.
 Step 4: Switch to the branch you want to update: If you are not already on the branch you want to update, use the following command to switch to the desired branch: ''' gitcheck '' Replace '' with the branch name  you want to update.
 Step 5: Merge  changes: Once you have checked out the upstream changes and switched to the appropriate branch, you can merge the changes with the following command: ''' git merge Upstream/ ''' Replace '' with the branch name of the  upstream repository  you want to merge with your forked repository.
 Step 6: Resolve conflicts (if any): In some cases, conflicts may arise during the merge process.
 Git will notify you of conflicts  and give you information about the conflicting files.
 Open these files in a text editor and resolve the conflicts manually.
 Once the conflict is resolved, save the file and continue the merge process.
 Step 7: Push  updated changes: After successfully merging the changes, you need to push the updated code to your forked repository.
 Use the following command: ''' git push origin ''' Replace '' with the name of the branch you updated.
 Conclusion: Keeping your forked repository up to date with  changes from the upstream repository is essential for collaboration and maintaining codebase integrity.
 By following the steps  in this guide, you can easily use git pull from an upstream branch and stay in sync with the latest changes.
 Remember to fetch the upstream changes, merge them into your local repository, resolve any conflicts, and finally push the updated changes to your forked repository.
 Happy collaborating!
