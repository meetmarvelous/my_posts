The terms "smart" and "clever" are often used interchangeably, but there is a subtle difference in their meanings.

"Smart" generally refers to a person's innate intelligence, their ability to learn quickly, understand complex concepts, and solve problems effectively. A person who is considered smart is often recognized for their exceptional intellectual abilities, academic achievements, and overall cognitive prowess.

On the other hand, "clever" refers to a person's ability to think creatively and come up with innovative solutions to problems. A clever person may not necessarily have the same level of innate intelligence as a smart person, but they are skilled at finding unconventional ways to solve problems, often using their wit and ingenuity.

In short, being smart is about having a high IQ, while being clever is about having a quick and creative mind. Both of these traits can be highly valued in different contexts, and a person can possess both of these qualities to varying degrees.
